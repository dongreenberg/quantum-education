    "   ```\n",
    " * However, backends each accept only a particular set of gates and follow a strict topology for 2-qubit connectivity. For example, the IBM Q backends only accept ['u1', 'u2', 'u3', 'id', 'cx'] gates, and submitting an `RZ` gate will throw an error. If you submit a circuit with 2-qubit gates which are not present on the chip, the backend will yell at you.\n",
    "  * Note that backends will dutifully execute the instructions exactly as specified in the Qobj. As of now there is no further rearranging or unrolling once a `Qobj` is submitted.\n",
    "  * If you are doing fancy things that require less aggressive transpilation, you should probably build a `PassManager` with a restricted set of passes rather than try to hand-compile.\n",
    "\n",
    " * You can call `transpile` yourself and print your circuit if you want to see what the transpiler did!"
